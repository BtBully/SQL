# SQL
Some SQL query examples in Jupyter Notebook

So far, it includes a Jupyter Notebook file of queries using a modified version of the Chinook example database.
This version of the database is from Dataquest: www.dataquest.io.

The examples include:
  - Completed excerises from the Dataquest Data Analysis course, with some additions
  - Additional queries, exploring the issues further
